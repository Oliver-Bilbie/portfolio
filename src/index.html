            Hi! My name is Ollie and I am a software engineer from Exeter in the
            UK. I specialize in web-development and I am particularly interested
            in writing fast code and architecting efficient applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page is an overview of some of the projects I have worked on
            for fun over the past few years. All of the source code for these
            applications is available on my GitHub along with some other bits
            and pieces including the source code for this page.

            this is happening? I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the
            stairs, Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited.
            Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report

            Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry.
            Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought
            I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those
            were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and
            hitchhiked around The Hive. You did come back different. Hi, Barry.
            Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You
            going to the funeral? No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting
            someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I
            guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this
            incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't
            need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
            Well, Adam, today we are men. We are! Bee-men. Amen! Hallelujah!
            Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
            Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15. That concludes our
            ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!

            Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up!
            Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all
            times. Wonder what it'll be like? A little scary. Welcome to Honex,
            a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it!
            Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to
            get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey
            begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
            Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,
            scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup
            with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! That girl was
            hot. She's my cousin! She is? Yes, we're all cousins. Right. You're
            right.

            At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee
            existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
            What do you think he makes? Not enough. Here we have our latest
            advancement, the Krelman. What does that do? Catches that little
            strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can
            anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
            But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
            But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the
            rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know
            that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a
            species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just
            work us to death? We'll sure try.

            It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned
            me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the
            other, he was slapping me! Oh, my! I never thought I'd knock him
            out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the
            authorities.

            I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it,
            comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles
            from here tomorrow. Six miles, huh? Barry! A puddle jump for us, but
            maybe you're not up for it. Maybe I am. You are not! We're going
            0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I
            might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you
            surprised me.
