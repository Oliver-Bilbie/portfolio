            Hi! My name is Ollie and I am a software engineer from Exeter in the
            UK. I specialize in web-development and I am particularly interested
            in writing fast code and architecting efficient applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page is an overview of some of the projects I have worked on
            for fun over the past few years. All of the source code for these
            applications is available on my GitHub along with some other bits
            and pieces including the source code for this page.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project is a website for my local road cycling club. As well as
            providing access to general information about the club, the
            application allows administrators to select a route for the week
            which will be displayed on the website and emailed to the mailing
            list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authentication is handled via Strava's OAuth2 implementation, where
            only administrators' Strava accounts have permission to set and
            update the route. Once authenticated, additional menus become
            available which will display all of the user's Strava routes and
            allow them to select one. A corresponding title and message can be
            provided, which are displayed on both the website and the email
            notifications. Club members can indicate whether they will be
            attending using buttons in the email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since search-engine-optimization is important for this particular
            project it is server-side-rendered. This is done using a serverless
            architecture to keep hosting costs minimal. Everything is written in
            Rust which keeps latency low compared to languages like JavaScript
            since no runtime is required on the underlying server which allows
            for quick cold-starts, as well as Rust generally being a fast
            language.
          </p>
          <p>
            The front-end of this project is rendered server-side in a Lambda
            function behind a CloudFront distribution, and back-end
            functionality is provided through Lambda functions behind an API
            Gateway.

          <p>
            Flight Guesser is a game designed to be played when the player spots
            an aircraft in the real world, where the objective is to guess where
            the aircraft has come from and/or where it is heading. Points are
            awarded based on proximity to the correct locations, based on data
            sourced from the Flight Radar API.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game has multiplayer functionality whereby a player can create a
            multiplayer lobby and share the code with friends, which will allow
            them to join the lobby. While in a multiplayer lobby, a real-time
            leaderboard will be available.
          </p>

            The front-end of this project is hosted from an S3 bucket behind a

            This project is a simple tool for learning foreign languages. Each
            round the player is presented with a word in the source language,
            and three words in the target language. The player must correctly
            identify the corresponding word in the target language to score a
            point. As the player progresses, more words are introduced until all
            of the 1000 most common words are included.
          </p>
          <p>
            The front-end of this project is hosted from an S3 bucket behind a
            CloudFront distribution. All logic is handled in the client so there
            is no need for any back-end services.

            The aim of this project is to synchronize a timer between a server
            and all of its connected clients whilst using a minimal number of
            requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            The implementation is driven by websockets which are automatically
            connected when a client is loaded. On connection, the websocket will
            push the current elapsed time to the client. The client will use its
            system clock to update the displayed value based on this offset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking the button will send a reset request to the server, which
            will trigger the server to push a zero offset value to all connected
            clients. Since the websockets will time-out and re-connect every
            five minutes, the displayed time should not drift significantly.
            Displayed times are generally within a tolerance of approximately
            one second, although this can be longer for slow connections.

            maybe you're not up for it. Maybe I am. You are not! We're going
            0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I
            might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you
