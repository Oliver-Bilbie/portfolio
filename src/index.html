          <p>
            Hi! My name is Ollie and I am a software engineer living in Austin
            Texas. I specialize in web development and I am particularly
            interested in writing performant code and architecting efficient
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page is a showcase of some of the projects I have worked on for
            fun over the past few years. All of the source code for these
            applications is available on
            <a href="https://github.com/Oliver-Bilbie">my GitHub</a> along with
            some other bits and pieces, including the source code for this page.

            Flight Guesser is a game designed to be played when the player spots
            an aircraft in the real world, where the objective is to guess where
            the aircraft has come from and/or where it is heading. Points are
            awarded based on proximity to the correct locations, based on data
            sourced from Flight Radar. The game has multiplayer functionality
            where players can create a multiplayer lobby and share a code for
            others to join. While in a multiplayer lobby, a real-time
            leaderboard will be available.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interface for this project is a single-page application written
            in React and hosted from an AWS S3 bucket. I decided to try out
            Zustand to manage the application state in this project, which I
            found to be a more ergonomic approach in this situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To keep server costs minimal, the APIs use AWS Lambda to execute
            code. The APIs are written in Python and are exposed through an API
            Gateway. The multiplayer API makes use of WebSocket connections to
            allow for real-time scoreboard updates to be pushed from the server
            to the client.

            This project is a prototype website for my local road cycling club
            which is not currently in use. As well as providing access to
            general information about the club, the application allows
            administrators to select a route for the week which will be
            displayed on the website and sent via email to the mailing list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authentication is handled via Strava's OAuth2 implementation, where
            only administrators' Strava accounts have permission to set and
            update the route. Once authenticated, additional menus become
            available which will display all of the user's Strava routes and
            allow them to select one. A corresponding title and message can be
            provided, which are displayed on both the website and the email
            notifications. Club members can indicate whether they will be
            attending the ride using buttons in the email.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since search-engine-optimization is important for this particular
            project, the user interface is server-side-rendered. I decided to
            try out Yew for this project, which is sort of like a React
            equivalent for Rust which compiles to WebAssembly. By wrapping the
            server-side rendering logic in an Axum HTTP server, I was able to
            get it to run inside of an AWS Lambda function. This architecture
            allows for reasonably fast page load times while keeping server
            costs minimal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The APIs for the application are written in Rust and executed using
            AWS Lambda. The mailing list is stored in DynamoDB, which is a
            decision made primarily to minimize server costs. Other data items
            such as the currently selected route are stored as SSM parameters so
            that they may be updated without needing to rebuild the back-end.

            In order to make this more visual and interactive, I have hacked
            together a web application to make it easier to run my solutions. My
            solutions have been compiled into WebAssembly and will run directly
            in the browser, which works on all platforms and provides
            near-native performance. The application uses a web worker pattern
            to allow programs to be safely terminated early, as well as to not
            block the main thread while they are running.

            The front-end of this project is hosted from an S3 bucket behind a
            CloudFront distribution. All logic is handled in the client so there
            is no need for any back-end services.

            This project is a simple tool for learning foreign languages. Each
            round the player is presented with a word in the source language,
            and three words in the target language. The player must correctly
            identify the corresponding word in the target language to score a
            point. As the player progresses, more words are introduced until all
            of the 1000 most common words are included.

            This project was a first attempt to familiarize myself with Yew

            The aim of this project is to synchronize a timer between a server
            and all of its connected clients whilst using a minimal number of
            requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            The implementation is driven by websockets which are automatically
            connected when a client is loaded. On connection, the websocket will
            push the current elapsed time to the client. The client will use its
            system clock to update the displayed value based on this offset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking the button will send a reset request to the server, which
            will trigger the server to push a zero offset value to all connected
            clients. Since the websockets will time-out and re-connect every
            five minutes, the displayed time should not drift significantly.
            Displayed times are generally within a tolerance of approximately
            one second, although this can be longer for slow connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was a proof of concept for using WebSockets with AWS
            Lambda functions through an API Gateway, which I later used in my
            Flight Guesser project.
